These firmwares are derived from JonnyC's dual_pwm/STAR_momentary firmware,
and are intended for use on ATTINY13A-based drivers with an electronic /
momentary switch.  Testing and development was done on a Ferrero Rocher DD
driver built by Comfychair of BLF.  This driver has red and green indicator
LEDs which are used to indicate approximate battery voltage, but that can be
disabled at compile time for use on other drivers.

Three different interfaces are provided:

  - Ferrero_Rocher: Similar to STAR_momentary, but with enhancements.

  - Ramping_UI_table: Smooth ramping UI.

  - Baton: Stepped ramping UI.

The interfaces are described in the .txt files for each.

The red/green indicators are calibrated for the following:

  - Green:  Battery is at 3.6V or more.
  - Yellow: Battery is at 3.3V to 3.6V.
  - Red:    Battery is below 3.3V.

The light may flicker between two colors when voltage is near a threshold.  In
particular, it has a tendency to flicker between green and yellow in the 3.6V
to 3.9V range, especially if using phase-correct PWM instead of fast PWM.
Flickering will be reduced with the "LOWPASS_VOLTAGE" option enabled, or
increased with that option disabled.  This is a matter of personal preference,
since the flickering can be used to get a better idea what the exact voltage
is, instead of using the coarse voltage ranges listed above.

Additionally, each time the light powers up, the main emitter should blink once
very briefly to let you know the batteries are connected.  This can be disabled
at compile time.
